# Worklog

One dense paragraph per completed packet, newest first:
date · packet · commit · notes (what changed, why, evidence, catches).
Incidents get their own entries: what happened, root cause, the
durable fix, the lesson now enforced.

2026-07-29 · M0-1..M0-4 (bootstrap sweep) · phase-0 · Repo initialized
(main unborn; work on phase-0). Scaffolding committed from dev-loop
templates with concept ratified same day. Gate tooling: Gemfile
(jekyll 4.4 / html-proofer 5 / minitest / rake, repo-local
vendor/bundle), Rakefile (lint/test/build/check/serve/gate),
script/lint.rb (no-JS, front-matter, relative-links, UTF-8 rules) +
test/lint_test.rb (6 tests). Evidence: `rake lint` clean on HEAD and
red on a seeded `<script>` tag (exit 1); `rake test` 6/6 green on
system Ruby 4.0.6. Site stub (config, null-theme layout, stylesheet
skeleton with light/dark, construction-sign index, CNAME edubba.ac);
CI (`rake gate` on push, Ruby 3.3 pin) + Pages deploy building with
our own bundle for local/CI parity (deliberate divergence from nabu's
actions/jekyll-build-pages — Jekyll version parity beats convention).
README v1 + LICENSE (CC BY-SA 4.0, source-texts carve-out). Catches:
`bundle install` correctly denied by our own fresh permission profile
(owner action — pending); zsh `status` is read-only, which aborted a
cleanup one-liner and left the seeded violation in the tree until
removed by hand — don't use `status` as a shell variable.
